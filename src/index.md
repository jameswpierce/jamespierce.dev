# James Willard Pierce

[[github]](https://github.com/jameswpierce) | <a rel="me" href="https://hachyderm.io/@jwp">[mastodon]</a>

I am a software engineer at [Real Geeks](https://realgeeks.com) where my primary focus is on the development of web-based applications.

I've also worked at [Super Basic](https://superbasic.xyz) and [Click Here Labs](https://clickherelabs.com).

Some of the technologies I am interested include Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Rust, React, Ruby, and Rails.

I take a consultative approach to the projects that I am involved with. Usually this means working across disciplines to help each understand the needs of the other, identifying and addressing pain points in the product development process, and implementing best practices along the way.

The end goal is to produce meaningful software that empowers people to achieve their personal and professional goals â€“ and to have a good time doing it.
