      <h1>Setting up a development environment for WordPress with Docker</h1>
<h2>Installing Docker</h2>
<p>The simplest way to get started with Docker is to install it via the Docker Desktop app.</p>
<p>You can find installation instructions and the download here:</p>
<p>https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/</p>
<h2>Initialize a new <code>git</code> repository</h2>
<p>We are going to call our project &quot;Eevee's Training Blog&quot;.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git init eevees-training-blog &amp;&amp; cd eevees-training-blog
</code></pre>
<h2>Provision our environment with <code>docker-compose</code></h2>
<p>Docker Compose allows us to programmatically provision and configure our development environment in a file <code>docker-compose.yml</code> that can be tracked in version control. This makes it simple to ensure that all developers on a team are working on the exact same environment, and to share updates to the environment as they happen.</p>
<h3>Initialize the database</h3>
<p>First create the file <code>docker-compose.yml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">touch docker-compose.yml
</code></pre>
<p>Then add these lines to it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yml"># docker-compose.yml

version: '3.3'

services:
  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    platform: linux/x86_64 # for m1 environments
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: billspc
      MYSQL_DATABASE: eevee_development
      MYSQL_USER: eevee
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: charizard
</code></pre>
<p>Then run <code>docker-compose up</code>. This will pull the image from the Docker registry and spin up a mysql server in a container! Press <code>ctrl-c</code> to stop the container.</p>
<h3>Initialize a WordPress server</h3>
<p>Wordpress maintains an image on the Docker public registry. We are going to pull that down and connect it to our environment's database</p>
<pre><code class="language-yml"># docker-compose.yml

...

services:
  ...
  wordpress:
    depends_on:
      - db # wordpress can't run without the db, so we let docker-compose know that here
    image: wordpress:5.8
    platform: linux/x86_64
    restart: always
    ports: 
      - 8000:80 # maps an external port '8000' to an internal port '80' this lets us see the container at localhost:8000
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306 # docker-compose lets us use the service name as the host url
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: eevee
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: charizard
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: eevee_development
</code></pre>
<p>Now when you run <code>docker-compose up</code> it will pull the WordPress image, configure it to pull data from the database service <code>db</code> and map its internal port <code>80</code> to a port <code>8000</code> on your host machine.</p>
<p>You can then run the &quot;famous five-minute install&quot;, by navigating in your browser to <code>http://localhost:8000</code></p>
<h3>Persist the data in the database</h3>
<p>We are at a pretty good spot here. But there is a weak link in the chain. If we have to do any work with our <code>mysql</code> service we could potentially lose the data we have on our development environment. At best, this could end up as a big time suck, so we are going to use another feature of Docker -- volumes -- to make sure our data is persisted on disk in a place that won't disappear unless we want it to.</p>
<p>We can define a volume for the mysql container like so</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># docker-compose.yml

# set up the volume
volumes:
  db_data: {}

# configure the db service to store data in the volume
services:
  db:
    ...
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
</code></pre>
<p>This defines a persistent volume, which will be initialized on <code>docker-compose up</code> and which will be able to be referenced even after a <code>docker-compose down</code></p>
<h3>Persist <code>wp-content</code> uploads</h3>
<p>The same issue presents itself with media uploads. We are going to persist this data in our working directory</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># docker-compose.yml

volumes:
  ...
  wp_content_uploads: {}

services:
  ...
  wordpress:
    ...
    volumes:
      - ./wp-content/uploads:/var/www/html/wp-content/uploads
</code></pre>
<p>Add this directory to your <code>.gitignore</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-git">/wp-content/uploads
</code></pre>
<p>And make sure it is created in your project</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir -p wp-content/uploads
</code></pre>
<h3>Connect project directories to wordpress Docker image</h3>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># docker-compose.yml

services:
  ...
  wordpress:
    ...
    volumes:
      ...
      - ./wp-content/plugins:/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins
      - ./wp-content/themes:/var/www/html/wp-content/themes
</code></pre>
<p>Now pull in whatever starter theme you want to your <code>wp-content/themes</code> directory.</p>
<p>I'm going to pull in <code>twentytwentyone</code> because its just the default with new wp installs</p>
<p>TODO: does this pull from container?</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir wp-content/themes
curl --output wp-content/themes/twentytwentyone.zip https://downloads.wordpress.org/theme/twentytwentyone.1.4.zip
unzip wp-content/themes/twentytwentyone.zip -d wp-content/themes
</code></pre>
<h3>Exposing <code>wp-config.php</code></h3>
<p>The official WordPress Docker image: https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress/ allows us to append whatever we want to its internal <code>wp-config.php</code> with an environment variable <code>WORDPRESS_CONFIG_EXTRA</code> that is configurable via <code>docker-compose.yml</code></p>
<p>We will set up a stub of this for the inevitable future:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># docker-compose.yml

...
services:
  ...
  wordpress:
    ...
    environment:
      ...
      WORDPRESS_CONFIG_EXTRA: |
         /* any line below will be added to wp-config.php on the docker container */
         /* define('SAY_HELLO', 'hello'); */
</code></pre>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>And that is it! You've got a working development environment, and a clean git repo. Any developer on your team with Docker installed can pull down the repository and spin up their environment within a few minutes, and that environment will be consistent across machines.</p>
